# Projet-DgitalLab-Credit-Agricole

In this project, we set ourselves several objectives:

- To draw up an inventory of the borrowers' insurance market.
- To understand the phenomenon of erosion in this market and its evolution over time.
- Conduct a customer behavioral analysis.
- Anticipate the substitution phenomenon.
- To think about an optimal commercial adjustment.

We started by making the databases more reliable, then transforming them at the project level. Then, we conducted a descriptive analysis to study the evolution of the the phenomenon of erosion in the loan insurance market and thus attempt to detect typical profiles of clients who are insured by an insurer other than Crédit Agricole. Finally, we conducted an explanatory analysis to predict first the delinking of borrowers and then the delinking of stock borrowers. 

After several improvement attempts we obtained scores in the range of 82<%. We presented our significant results in an easy-to-use Dash application. This application estimates the risk of a commercial client to change insurance and the risk of a new customer to switch to external insurance by analyzing their different data, i.e. age, amount granted, amount of the next maturity, etc. 

Finally, we managed to build good models with a score of 80%. The Crédit Agricole would be able to recover about 80% of the revenue in 2022 by offering personalized services to its customers.
